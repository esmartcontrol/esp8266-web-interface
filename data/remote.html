<h2>Remote Support Module</h2>
Welcome to remote support! In order for this module to work, this page must be opened on
a device that is connected to both the inverter AND the internet. There are multiple ways
to achieve this. Pick the one that suits you best.
<ul>
<li>Open it on a smart phone that is connected to the internet via mobile data and to the inverter via wifi. Make sure your phone never enters standby mode during the support session.
<li>Open it on a regular PC/laptop that is connected to the internet via Ethernet and connected to the inverter via wifi
<li>Make the inverter wifi module connect to your local hotspot and access this wifi interface via the hotpot assigned IP address
</ul>
Below you can see which commands are issued by remote support.
